        "Coronary heart disease (CHD), also referred to as coronary artery disease (CAD) involves the reduction of blood flow to the heart muscle due to the build-up of plaque in the arteries of the heart. It is the most common form of cardiovascular disease. Currently, invasive coronary angiography represents the gold standard for establishing the presence, location, and severity of CHD. However, this diagnostic method is costly and associated with morbidity (count of people with the disease) and mortality (count of deaths) in CHD patients. Therefore, it would be beneficial to develop a non-invasive alternative to replace the current gold standard.\n",
        "\n",
        "Other less invasive diagnostics methods have been proposed in the scientific literature including exercise electrocardiogram, thallium scintigraphy, and fluoroscopy of coronary calcification. However, the diagnostic accuracy of these tests only ranges between 35%-75%. Therefore, it would be beneficial to develop a computer-aided diagnostic tool that could utilize the combined results of these non-invasive tests in conjunction with other patient attributes to boost the diagnostic power of these non-invasive methods with the aim of ultimately replacing the current invasive gold standard.\n",

No patient had a history of or electrocardiographic evidence of prior myocardial infarction or known valvular or cardiomyopathic diseases.\n"

The 13 features include the results of the aforementioned non-invasive diagnostic tests along with other relevant patient information.
